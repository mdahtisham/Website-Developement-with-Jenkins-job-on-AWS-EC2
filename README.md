# Website-Development-with-Jenkins-job-on-AWS-EC2

PROJECT-II

*Website Development with Jenkins job on AWS-EC2*

A Continous Integration & Continous Deployment demonstrating the Jenkins Job and how it is works for a website development project.

Technologies Used - Jenkins, AWS-EC2, Apache2, Git & Github


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Step :-

1.Launch the EC2 Instance in AWS-Ubuntu

2.Install the Jenkins in EC2-Instance and Access the Jenkins

3.Configure the Job and write the required command in execution shell

4.Build the Jenkins Job

5.It will Install the Webserver in EC2-Instance and Jenkins connected with Github repository as well as Webserver

*Lets Configure Jenkins Now*

- Open Jenkins on web-browser using URL

      URL: http://aws_ip_adress:8080
      
- You will need to to get the token from

      /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminpassword
      
- Open EC2-instance again type the given command

      [root@ip--] # cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminpassword
      
- Copy the text and paste into the jenkins login page you will get jenkins access

- Select Install suggested plugins

- Click on the Dashboard and Create a Job

- Click on the new item

      name - websitedevelopment
      choose - freestyle project
      
- Click on the OK button 

- Click on the job configure

      Description - Website Development with Jenkins freestyle job
      Source code - Git # Paste the Github repository URL
      Branch to build - master to main          # rename
      Build triggers - POLL SCM * * * * *       
      
      
     - Build step - Execute Shell
     
                   sudo apt install -y git
                   sudo apt install -y apache2
                   sudo systemctl start apache2
                   sudo systemctl enable apache2
                   sudo rm -rf /var/www/html
                   sudo rm -rf /var/www
                   sudo git clone <github repository> /var/www/html
    
    
- Click on apply or save

- Click on Build


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*Access the Website*

- Open Browser using URL

      URL: http://<aws_ip_adress>
      
- Now you can see the website is accessible and It is configured with Continous Integration & Continous Development
      
      
      
*When the developer do changes in repository code or do the commit with changes. In every commit jenkins will automatically pull the code from github and deploy into the webserver. It will reflect with in a minute it is knows as Continous Integration & Continous Development*

# Jenkins 


Jenkins is an open source automation server. It helps automate the parts of software development related to building, testing, and deploying, facilitating continuous integration and continuous delivery. It is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat. It supports version control tools, including AccuRev, CVS, Subversion, Git, Mercurial, Perforce, ClearCase and RTC, and can execute Apache Ant, Apache Maven and sbt based projects as well as arbitrary shell scripts and Windows batch commands.


# AWS EC2 Instance


An Amazon EC2 instance is a virtual server in Amazon's Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for running applications on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) infrastructure. AWS is a comprehensive, evolving cloud computing platform; EC2 is a service that enables business subscribers to run application programs in the computing environment. It can serve as a practically unlimited set of virtual machines (VMs).


Amazon provides various types of instances with different configurations of CPU, memory, storage and networking resources to suit user needs. Each type is available in various sizes to address specific workload requirements.


# Git 

Git is a version control system that is widely used in the programming world. It is used for tracking changes in the source code during software development. It was developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system kernel.


# Github

GitHub is an online software development platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on software projects. It enables developers to upload their own code files and to collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects. GitHub also serves as a social networking site in which developers can openly network, collaborate, and pitch their work.


# Apache

Apache is a web server software that is responsible for accepting HTTP requests from visitors and sending them back the requested information in the form of web pages.
Another way to look at it is that Apache is responsible for ensuring that the server your website is stored on can communicate with the device a visitor is using. Itâ€™s what connects the visitor hardware to your own.
